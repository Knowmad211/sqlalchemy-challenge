Module 10 Challenge

This is my submission for the hoework assignment for Module 10- SQLAlchemy

The prompt for this assignment is as follows:
"Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task."

The data used was provided to us in the "Resources" folder in my repository, and the "climate-starter.ipynb" was the starting Jupyter Notebook we were provided with.

The file "abushacra_analysis.ipynb" is my Jupyter Notebook with my analysis of the data, while the "app.py" file is my Flask API.

This task was very difficult for me and I used multiple resurces to complete the assignment, often using existing code provided in class or from other students as inspiration for my own notebook:
- Class notes
- Class examples and solutions
- StackOverflow
- GitHub repositories of other students
- ChatGPT
- Working with my classmates to troubleshoot my code
- Tutoring sessions
